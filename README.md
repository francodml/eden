# Eden - Fancy fullscreen cover

## Why
I have a secondary monitor.
As it stands, it's pretty useful when I'm using it, but rather ueless when I'm not.

At first, I was just going to put a clock on it. Now I want a full widget framework.

## Why not something else? (Rainmeter, Wallpaper Engine, etc...)
I'm stubborn and I like programming.
Plus, a secondary objective of this project is to create a C# UI framework that supports CSS for styling, where controls are classes that provide event handlers, and it works like an HTML DOM (Heavily inspired by Facepunch's s&box way of handling UI)

## Goals
A widget engine, with a DOM-like UI model and flexbox/Yoga layout, and CSS/Sass for general UI styles.
